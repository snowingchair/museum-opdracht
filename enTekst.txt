# Intro_text{
                        Nxt Museum is the first museum in the Netherlands to focus entirely on media art.
                    We exhibit artworks that use modern technologies of the present and future.
                    Because art reflects the spirit of the times,
                    we believe that the most innovative art gives us the opportunity to reflect on the impact of technological developments.
                    A moment of reflection in a reality that continues to evolve faster and faster.}
